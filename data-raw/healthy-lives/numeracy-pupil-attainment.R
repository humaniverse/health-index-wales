# ---- Clean data ----
# Filtered dataset includes GCSES numeracy point score for each local authority for academic year 2022/2023
# Numeracy point score is calculated by taking the average of the scores for all 2022/2023 GCSE students, using their best score out of GCSE Mathematics or GCSE Mathematics â€“ numeracy 
# Scores are allocated to each student based on GCSE grade: Grade A* = 58, Grade A = 52, Grade B = 46, Grade C = 40, Grade D = 34, Grade E = 28, Grade F = 22, Grade G = 16, Grade U/X = 0
# Or if using 1-9 grading system: Grade 9 score = 58, Grade 8 score = 55, Grade 7 score = 52, Grade 6 score = 48, Grade 5 score = 44, Grade 4 score = 40, Grade 3 score = 32, Grade 2 score = 24, Grade 1 score = 16, Grade U Score = 0
