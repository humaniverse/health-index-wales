# Health Index for Wales

The Health Index for Wales is based on the [Office for National Statistics Health Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/developingthehealthindexforengland/2015to2018), which includes three domains:

- Healthy people
- Healthy lives
- Healthy places

This repo is a work in progress. All data and outputs need to be carefully reviewed. 

Data collection is paused until 2025, when the new [StatsWales API](https://digitalanddata.blog.gov.wales/2024/10/02/latest-update-for-statswales-odata-users/) will be in place.
